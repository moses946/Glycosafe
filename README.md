# GlycoSafe

## Introduction
Diabetes management requires careful monitoring of food intake, especially the glycemic load of meals, which directly impacts blood sugar levels. However, most individuals, particularly those in low-resource settings, struggle to manually estimate the glycemic load of their meals. Traditional methods involve referencing food databases, weighing portions, and performing manual calculations, which can be time-consuming and prone to inaccuracies.

Additionally, current dietary assessment tools often rely on subjective user input, leading to potential errors and inconsistencies. There is a need for an automated, image-assisted approach to simplify this process and provide reliable glycemic load estimates.

## The Solution
GlycoSafe is an AI-powered mobile application that estimates the glycemic load of meals using image recognition. Users simply capture a photo of their meal, and the system processes the image to identify food items, estimate portion sizes, and calculate the corresponding glycemic load.

### Key Features:
- **Image-Based Food Recognition**: Uses machine learning models to analyze food images and detect meal components.
- **Glycemic Load Calculation**: Automatically computes the glycemic load based on recognized food items and portion sizes.
- **Nutritional Insights**: Provides a detailed breakdown of macronutrients and dietary recommendations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Enables diabetic patients and health-conscious individuals to monitor their diet effortlessly.
- **Integration with Health Tools**: Allows users to log meals, track historical data, and receive personalized insights for better diabetes management.
